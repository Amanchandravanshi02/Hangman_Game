## Introduction

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This implementation is written in Python and runs in the console.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly choose a word from a predefined list.
2. You have 10 attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
3. Each incorrect guess will reduce your remaining attempts and bring the hangman closer to being fully drawn.
4. If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts, you win!
5. If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, you lose and the hangman will be fully drawn.

## Game Rules

- Only valid alphabetical characters (a-z) are accepted as input.
- Repeating a previously guessed letter will notify you without penalizing your remaining attempts.
- Each incorrect guess will result in drawing another part of the hangman.
